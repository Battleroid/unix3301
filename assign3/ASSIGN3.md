Assignment 3
============

Form is required to do:

1. Reset functionality.
2. Save to database or file.
	* JSON (personal preference, easier to work with)
	* plain text
3. Retrieval of contacts from database and display them in table.
4. View contacts from file.
	* JSON retrieval of information would be easy.
	* Plain text information would be doable as well. It would be easy to have the data saved in an easy to read format to begin with.
5. 'Thank You' or success page, with link back to form.
6. Directory page full of the entered contacts.
	* Unsure: does he want this from the database or the text file, or both? If so, JSON **will** be used regardless of what he wants. I do not want to spend ages making annoying regexp to capture data.
7. Error handling with expected content. e.g. no blank names, contacts, addresses, must be valid content.
